# A hybrid Cloud–Edge SDV Application Lifecycle Management - Phase 1

This blueprint demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for developing, validating and orchestrating Mixed-Critical Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) applications across cloud and HPC edge device.

It showcases how SDV applications are built in the cloud, pushed to a registry, and deployed onto an in-vehicle HPC running AOS Core and digital.auto runtime components such as MQTT, KUKSA, and a Signal Gateway. Vehicle signals are exchanged across heterogeneous compute domains with HPCs and Zonal compute — through uProtocol and Zenoh.

# Sample Use Case

## User Journey

**Smart Wipers**

|                          | Turn on wipers            | open door / trunk                                                              | Turn off Wipers                                                           |
| :----------------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Who**                  | Driver                    | User                                                                           | System                                                                    |
| **What**                 | Wipers turned on manually | User opens the car door/trunk and the open status of door/trunk is set to true | The wiping is immediately turned off by the software and user is notified |
| **Customer TouchPoints** | Windshield wiper switch   | Door/trunk handle                                                              | Notification on car dashboard and mobile app                              |


## Backend technology

1. App developer writes an application and validates in digital.auto playground
1. After successful validation, App developer publishes the application in a cloud App Registry
1. OEM deploys digital.auto sdv runtime into existing E/E architecture which abstracts the underlying vehicle complexity for applications.
1. OEM creates a AosCore instance with digital.auto runtime
1. OEM creates AosCloud configuration for app orchestration
1. OEM performs trial deployment from cloud App Registry and tests via digital.auto playground
1. OEM centrally deploys application from cloud App Registry into vehicle fleet (OTA)

# Getting started

## Prerequisites
1. For this blueprint ubuntu-cloud image is used on qemu. Theretically any other linux image should also work, but not tested.
1. Install docker inside the qemu image

## Demo
1. Start the **QEMU virtual machine** and log in using the configured credentials.
2. Pull the SDV Runtime Container Image `docker pull ghcr.io/eclipse-autowrx/sdv-runtime:latest`
3. Run the SDV Runtime Container `docker run -d -e RUNTIME_NAME="MyRuntimeName" ghcr.io/eclipse-autowrx/sdv-runtime:latest`

Here, RUNTIME_NAME: This is the runtime ID used to register the runtime in `playground.digital.auto`.

4. Register the Runtime in digital.auto Playground - https://playground.digital.auto

    1. Login to the platform
    2. Go to **Profile → My Assets**
    3. Navigate to **Runtimes**
    4. Click **Add Asset**
    5. Enter the **Runtime Name** (same as `RUNTIME_NAME`)
    6. Select **Type = Runtime**
    7. Click **Save**
    
5. Verify Runtime Functionality and To verify the runtime:

    1. Open any **Prototype Model** which you have created before
    2. Select the **Runtime** created above
    4. Execute the code
